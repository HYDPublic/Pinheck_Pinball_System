----------Tell PIC to set states that the PROP can detect: (PIC -> PROP)-----------


[aXXY] - I/O test (returns {aACK})

Set pin XX to state Y (numeric)


[bXXZ] - GI bank set (returns {bACK})

Set GI bank to state xx bits


[cXXZ] - Light matrix set (returns {cACK})

Set light matrix to state xx bits (row and column)


[dXZZ] - Switch column set (returns {dACK})

Set switch column to state x


[eZZZ] - RGB set (returns {eACK})

Set on-board RGB bank to xxx (RGB) 


[fZZZ] - External RGB set (returns {fACK})

Set external RGB bank to xxx (RGB) 


[gXYZ] - External RGB pin toggle (returns {gACK})

Set external RGB data pin to state X (ASCII 0 or 1, low or high)
Set external RGB clock pin to state Y (ASCII 0 or 1, low or high)





Report states detected on pinHeck board (PROP -> PIC)


[iYZZ] - Check I2C devices # Y (returns {iXZZ})

Returns if I2C devices are present

X = 1: I2C device at location Y is present
X = 0: I2C device at location Y is not present

Stores device number X in memory for further reads and writes


[rXYZ] - Read I2C byte located at high byte X, low byte Y in memory

Returns {rXYB} whereas XY is the address selected, and B is the byte read

Returns {rZZZ} if fail


[wXYB] - Write byte B at high byte X, low byte Y in memory

Returns {wXYB} whereas XY is the address selected, and w is the byte that was written

Returns {wZZZ} if fail


[mZZZ] -I/O state (returns {mXXZ})

Sends the state of the 16 bits of cabinet switches as XX


[nZZZ] -I/O state (returns {nXZZ})

Sends switch row I/O state (8 bits) as X
