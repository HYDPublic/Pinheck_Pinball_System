Tell PIC to set states that the PROP can detect: (PIC -> PROP)

[aXXY] - I/O test (returns {aACK})

Set pin XX to state Y (numeric)

[bXXZ] - GI bank set (returns {bACK})

Set GI bank to state xx bits

[aXXZ] - Light matrix set (returns {cACK})

Set light matrix to state xx bits (row and column)

[aXZZ] - Switch column set (returns {dACK})

Set switch column to state x

[aZZZ] - RGB set (returns {eACK})

Set on-board RGB bank to xxx (RGB) 

[aZZZ] - RGB set (returns {fACK})

Set external RGB bank to xxx (RGB) 



Report states detected on pinHeck board (PROP -> PIC)

[mZZZ] -I/O state (returns {mXXZ})

Sends the state of the 16 bits of cabinet switches

[nZZZ] -I/O state (returns {nXZZ})

Sends switch row I/O state (8 bits)
